Your mailbox just got hit in an accident. This means you have to head to Bunnings and buy a new one.
Since you've had that old mailbox for years you have decided to shell out a budget of $1000 including installation and location.
You've come across a mailbox with a lock that looks okay, however, you have also come across a better looking mailbox with no lock.

There is a choice of option 1 with the mailbox with a lock or option 2 with the mailbox without?
