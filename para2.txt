You have picked the mailbox WITHOUT a lock.

This mailbox offers minimal protection against people trying to steal your mail.
However, now you must think about packages that can't fit in the mailboxes?
You must pick a new location for the mailbox.


There is a choice of option 1 that has you placing the mailbox next to a wall that couriers can place packages behind so that they aren't easily visible.
You can also pick option 2 that has you placing the mailbox right in the front of the house.
